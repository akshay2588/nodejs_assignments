<b>Homework Assignment #1</b><br>
Please create a simple "Hello World" API. Meaning:
1. It should be a RESTful JSON API that listens on a port of your choice. 
2. When someone posts anything to the route /hello, you should return a welcome message, in JSON format. This message can be anything you want.
<br>Note: as a additional feature, this API can expect query string parameter "name" and give customized welcome message. If the query string parameter is empty then it will simply say "Welcome Guest User"
